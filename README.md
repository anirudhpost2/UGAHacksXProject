# UGAHacksXProject
By Anirudh Venkataraghavan

This is my UGAHacks Challenge Project, from the HPCC Systems Challenge. As ECL was the primary language required for this challenge, I used ECL, and I did some of the challenges while learning the language. The purpose of this project is for me to show what I have learned about ECL this weekend, and I hope to strengthen my ECL technicality in future hackathons as well. As this language was completely unfamiliar to me, it took a lot of time to learn the fundamentals of ECL. However, participating in this Hackathon and specifically this challenge has been my biggest achievement thus far.
